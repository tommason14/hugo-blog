title: Predicting Entropic Effects of Water Mixing with Ionic Liquids
weight: 400
---
  
Study into the interactions of water with various hydrogen-bonding ionic liquids. 
We show that water incorporates itself into choline-based ionic liquids with 
minimal adverse effects on the neat ionic structure, 
resulting in a lower entropic penalty when compared to imidazolium-based ILs.
Electronic properties were studied along with effects on IR spectra from a theoretical perspective.
